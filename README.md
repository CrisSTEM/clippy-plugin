## How to Use Clippy

Once installed:

* **Automatic Tips:** Clippy will appear on most webpages you visit, usually at the bottom right. Every 30 seconds, it'll offer a new, useless AI-generated tip relevant to the page content, complete with dynamic animations.
* **Page Interaction:** Sometimes, just by clicking around on a page, Clippy might pop up with a little comment like "Looks like you are exploring this page!" and a random animation.

## Important Note on Compatibility

Clippy loves to offer tips, but some highly secure websites (like parts of Google, including YouTube or `Googleusercontent.com` domains) use advanced security features called **'Trusted Types'** or strict **Content Security Policies (CSP)**. These features prevent the injection of external JavaScript, which means Clippy might not appear on these specific sites. This is a security feature implemented by the website and browser, not a limitation of the extension on compatible pages.
